#CS 410P Rust
Various code consisting of homework for an introductory Rust class I am taking, as examples from the book. The book we are using for the class is *Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development* by Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff (ISBN 978-1-491-92728-1) and all code in a folder with a chapter number in the practice folder will be from or adapted from example code from this book unless otherwise stated.
