#Homework 1: Calc
I actually don't have a whole ton to say about how I did this because mainly it was pretty easy. I just used the formatting in the book. There wasn't a ton of challenge to it. I did struggle a bit figuring out how to run it on command line in VS Code, but once I had figured that out, the rest was pretty easy. I just wrote the functions, then I wrote some test functions, and I wrote an if statement for when you ran the program. I guess it was a little bit challenging figuring out how to get the arguments from the command line when you were mixing strings and integers. I had to look that part up. But in general, not bad. I have nothing else to say. Please give me full credit.
