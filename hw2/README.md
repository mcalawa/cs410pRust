I started with raindrops because it's basically just PNW FizzBuzz, so I knew I could knock it out real quick. I originally thought I'd have to get the full factorization and figure out how many 3s and 5s and 7s there were in order to know what to print, but since 9 was just "Pling" instead of "PlingPling" in the tests, I just had to do some if statements with a mod. Quick and easy.

Did the robot simulator next. If I was doing this as an actual program, I'd make sure we were checking for lowercase as well as caps and would have some sort of error checking if they included instructions that weren't 'R', 'L', or 'A', but as this is just for practice, I didn't bother.

Did isbn-verifier next. Was able to use the things I'd figured out on the previous one to work on this one. Had a bit of trouble with the borrow checker, but nothing I couldn't figure out.

Did Bob next. Just one left to go!

I decided to look up the formula for figuring out what the correct pythagorean triplet was because, while I am pretty good at math, I am far from being a math nerd and it has been a while since I last took a math class. I'm sure I could come up with it on my own, but I don't feel that doing so would be worth my time or would actually demonstrate my ability to code and reason through problems so much as it would demonstrate how quickly I could solve a math problem.
